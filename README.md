## Description
Are you looking for a framework of a social network API that'll allow you to add users and delete users, along with other actions? Look no further! This Social Network API is perfect for storing user information, such as username, email, thoughts, and reactions, and the range of actions this API can perform is extensive.

## Installation
Before you do anything, make sure that you have MongoDB Compass installed on your PC or Mac. You can download MongoDB Compass at https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/administration/install-community/. Once that's installed, go to your terminal to finish installing the API. 

First, type "cd -directory-name" in your terminal to access the folder that the app is located. Once you're in the correct folder, type "npm i" or "npm install" to install all of the necessary packages. Next, type "npm run build" to build the application to prepare it for deployment. Once that's done, type "npm run start" to test the API on an application such as Insomnia.

## Usage
The Social Network API can be used as a database to store user information and make changes to user information or thoughts and reactions when necessary. For an idea of all the actions this API can perform, please watch the demo videos here:

## Contribution
First, I'd like to thank Columbia University Coding Bootcamp for providing me with examples of the code needed to complete this API. I used the example code as a reference to complete the code necessary to make it work. Additionally, anyone is free to fork the repo and create a pull request if you'd like to make additions to the code to add useful features to enhance the app. Also, please give this app a star! I would truly appreciate it!

## Tests
All tests have been conducted on this API. If you want a preview of how the API works, please check the usage section for a video preview and screenshots! Also, if you want to test the API on your PC or Mac, install an Application like Insomnia that helps you to check each route and perform different actions to ensure that the API is working properly.
